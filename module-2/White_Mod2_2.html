        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Mallorie White. I grew up in Bellevue, NE. My father was in the Air Force BUT we did not travel at all. My parents came from Mississippi,settled in Bellevue, NE and did not move again. My dad did have assignments elsewhere but we stayed in Bellevue.<span class="sentence">I later appreciated this because I was able to make lifelong friends!</span></p>
        
        <p>I have always been fascinated with technology and how it works. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems. I enjoy learning new coding languages and building creative projects.</p>
        
        <p>I am a single mother of two beautiful children: Alleyah, 16 and Gabriel,8. Most of my free time is spent running them around to their activities and being their cheerleader. After a busy day if running around, I actually found that learning code helps me relax!</p>
